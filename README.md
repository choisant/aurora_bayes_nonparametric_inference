# Bayesian nonparametric inference (under exchangeability)
This repository contains mathematical background and code for Bayesian nonparametric inference under exchangeability.

The R functions depeloped here aspire to become an R package soon.

A more detailed explanation and an instruction manual will be posted as soon as possible. Feel free to take a look at the [draft on the theoretical foundation](https://github.com/pglpm/bayes_nonparametric_inference/blob/main/omni-predictor_machine.pdf).
