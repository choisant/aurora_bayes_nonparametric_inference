== List of functions provided by the software, and logic of their use ==

• buildvarinfo(data, file=NULL):
  Helps the user to prepare a file contain prior information about the variates, such as:
  – type (binary, nominal, ordinal, continuous)
  – censoring or rounding
  – domain
  – location and dispersion
  – required plot ranges

• buildvarinfoaux(data, varinfo, file=TRUE):
  Has to be called once the "varinfo" file is ready. It prepares a file having auxiliary info about variates and data, necessary for the computation, such as:
  – variate type
  – censoring or rounding
  – number of values
  – quartiles

• inferdensity(varinfoaux, data, ...):
  Can be called once the auxiliary varinfo file is ready
  This function performs the Markov-chain Monte Carlo computation of the probability distribution over the possible long-run frequency distributions. The output is saved in a file.

• longrunsamples(...):
  Calculates samples of long-run frequencies for the specified variate values,
  or report their average, corresponding to the current probabilities for those values. These frequencies can also be marginal or conditional.

• samplelongrun(...):
  generate samples, for the specified variates, from:
  – either a sample of long-run frequency distribution,
  – or the current probability distribution (expectation of the long-run frequency distributions).
  These samples can also be marginal or conditional.

• Additional functions to compute mutual information and relative entropy.

– The "sample" functions might also produce plots.
