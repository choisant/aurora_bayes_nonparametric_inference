Dear Luca,

Thanks for the email. It is always good to hear from users or potential users. :-)

Yes, the package can fit a simple Gaussian mixture model. You can do so by using the option "excludeY" in the "profRegr" function.

Hope this helps.

Best wishes
Silvia

The review of the various sampling schemes and the discussion on diagnostics for convergence and mixing were extremely useful!

From the PReMiuM manual it seems that the main function of the package does profile regression. My purpose is to do simple continuous-variable prediction (in the context of exchangeable sequences), similarly to the setup described in §3.1 of your paper in J. Stat. Software (but without too much focus on clustering). Does PReMiuM have any functions for this?
